          I'm a 5th-year Bioengineering Ph.D. candidate at Stanford developing low-cost, high-throughput 3D printing hardware and pipelines for biofabrication of cardiac tissues in <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/skylarscottlab.html">Mark Skylar-Scott's 3D-bioprinting lab</a>. 

          My recent work and interest focuses on 3D computer-aided design (CAD) and device prototyping towards building motion control systems, specifically 3D bioprinters. I have developed various bioprinter technologies and use them to fabricate soft-material structures, including silicone elastomers, photocurable hydrogels, and cell-laden engineered tissues. The biological applications of my fabrication work include the printing of custom-geometry heart valves and small-scale cardiac and stem cell tissue models that I have used to study function, growth, and maturation.

          **I am looking for a research position beginning in fall 2025** that blends these engineering disciplines to develop impactful technologies with applications in the life-sciences or beyond.
